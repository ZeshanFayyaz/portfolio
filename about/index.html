        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a software engineer and researcher with a focus on building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My work spans machine learning, distributed systems, and data engineering, often at the intersection of research and production. What drives me most is the challenge of taking complex ideas and turning them into solutions that actually work at scale. I always aim to solve problems that have real-world industry relevance.

        <h2>Academic Foundation</h2>
        <p>
          I completed my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, where I focused on federated learning, secure computation, and privacy-preserving AI. Before that, I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from TMU. Throughout that journey, I published several papers, worked on large-scale research projects, and learned how to bridge theory with application. Publishing papers as early as undergrad is something that not many people can say they've done, but it is something I am extremely proud of.

        <h2>Engineering in Practice</h2>
        <p>
          My work experience has been about more than just writing code, it’s been about building systems that make an impact. I’ve worked on encryption-optimized federated learning pipelines, designed data infrastructure for large-scale processing, and contributed to open-source projects like <code>jupyterlab-git</code>. Whether it’s improving security, scalability, or performance, I’m always looking for ways to push technical boundaries while staying grounded in practicality.

        <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
        <p>
          Research and software engineering are a huge part of my life, but it’s not all of it. Going to the gym and playing basketball is my reset button, and my way to stay disciplined, focused, and grounded. One of my recent interests is science-based weightlifting. I also love exploring new places, learning about space and physics, and constantly finding new things that challenge how I think.

        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy working on problems that don’t have obvious answers and collaborating with people who are just as curious and driven. For me, the goal has always been simple: to keep learning, keep building, and keep finding new ways to create real value through technology.
